There are two files in the `rotate` folder: input.txt and output.txt.

1. Write a command line program that will read the input file and generate the output file.
1. Provide instructions of how to run the script on a linux or MacOs machine.

## Introduction

This simple code challenge can be done in any programming language of your choice while you show us the best of your programming skills.  Although it would be wonderful to see a program that will take any input file and produce the output file for any compliant set of inputs, the purpose of this code challenge is really to assess your skills and your ability to logically understand and solve the task at hand.  There will be a discussion of your code to assess your thought process in developing the program and to gauge whether you are a good fit for this internship.

## Title: Image processing

**Given**:

1. The input file `input.txt`.
2. The output file `output.txt`.

**Expected**:

1. Write a command line program that will read the `input.txt` file and generate the output file `output.txt`
2. The `input.txt` and `output.txt` files provided are only a sample, so the program should be able to take any text file that looks like an ASCII image and process it in the same manner as this sample.
3. Provide instructions or bash script for running the program.

## Your challenge:

Write a program that will read the input file `input.txt`, partition sort each line according to the partitioned sort method described above, and output the result to an output file `my-outupt.txt`.

**Bonus**:  Use git to create commits as you develop the code including any design or redesign stages you go through developing the code.
